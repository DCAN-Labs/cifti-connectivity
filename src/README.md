# `src` folder

This folder contains all of the scripts used by the `cifti_conn_wrapper.py` wrapper. There should be at least 15 files in this folder, including this `README`. The other 14 are listed below:

## Files to run compiled scripts
All of these files were created by the MATLAB compiler and must be in this folder for `cifti_conn_wrapper.py` to run.

### Compiled MATLAB Scripts
1. `cifti_conn_matrix_for_wrapper`
1. `cifti_conn_pairwise_corr_exaversion`
1. `cifti_conn_template_for_wrapper`

### BASH Scripts to Run Compiled MATLAB Scripts
1. `run_cifti_conn_matrix_for_wrapper.sh`
1. `run_cifti_conn_pairwise_corr_exaversion.sh`
1. `run_cifti_conn_template_for_wrapper.sh`

## Other files
Although these files are not necessary for `cifti_conn_wrapper.py` to run, they are included in case changes need to be made to the MATLAB scripts, which would then need to be re-compiled.

### Uncompiled MATLAB Scripts
1. `cifti_conn_matrix_for_wrapper.m`
1. `cifti_conn_pairwise_corr_exaversion.m`
1. `cifti_conn_template_for_wrapper.m`

### Other MATLAB Compiler Inputs
1. `compile.sh`
1. `isthisanoutlier.m`

### Other MATLAB Compiler Outputs
1. `auto_generated_readme.txt`
1. `mccExcludedFiles.log`
1. `requiredMCRProducts.txt`
